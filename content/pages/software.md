# List of Software

Here is a list of programs I maintain, develop, and/or contribute to:

- I work on a Google Summer of Code project for [SciML](https://github.com/SciML/), contributing identifiability algorithm to the toolkit. We recently ported [`StructuralIdentifiability.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl) which I help maintain.
- I develop and maintain [Structural Identifiability Toolbox](https://maple.cloud/app/6509768948056064/Structural+Identifiability+Toolbox). An online tool for assessing parameter identifiability.
- I maintain [SIAN-Julia](https://github.com/alexeyovchinnikov/SIAN-Julia), see dev fork [here](https://github.com/iliailmer/SIAN-Julia).
- I contributed to [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)
- As a personal project, I wrote a `numpy` deep learning library in the style of PyTorch: [numpy-learn](https://github.com/iliailmer/numpy_learn)
- I wrote a cli tool for gitignore file creation [gitignore-create](https://github.com/iliailmer/gitignore-create). Install it via `pip install gitignore-create` and run `gitignore-create -n <your file type here>` to get started!
- I am also a fan of Kaggle competitions for machine learning (especially love them when there is enough time for them!).
