# Project Updates

We slightly churned our project idea from the original algorithm implementation into an inclusion of a `StructuralIdentifiability.jl` package develop by my colleague [Gleb Pogudin](https://pogudingleb.github.io/). The package is currently part of SciML with more updates to come!

Here is a list of things it can do:

- check local identifiability of parameters
- check global identifiability of parameters
- check for identifiable functions (work-in-progress feature)

# Future Directions

We plan to add more tutorials, finalize registering the package, and make it compatible with ODE systems defined in other SciML projects!
