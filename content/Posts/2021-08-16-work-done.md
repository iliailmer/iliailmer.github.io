[TOC]

Over the course of the summer, my work resulted in successfully ported code of `StructuralIdentifiability.jl`, a package that can help researchers who use ordinary differential equations in their work. The package allows answering queries about individual identifiability of parameters and their combinations. 

The `StructuralIdentifiability.jl` package is ready to use! ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽŠ ðŸ˜„

You can install from source:

```julia
> ]add https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl
```

or via `Pkg`:

```julia
> using Pkg
> Pkg.add("StructuralIdentifiability")
```

You can check the documentation at [this link](https://si.sciml.ai/dev/). To get started, I recommend checking out [this tutorial](https://si.sciml.ai/dev/tutorials/local_identifiability/) on local identifiability.

## Contributions

Over the course of the summer, my contributions ranged from tutorials to compatibility with broader `SciML` infrastructure. Here is a list of my contributions with links to relevant Pull Requests (PRs).

### Closed PRs

-   [#13](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/13): update dependencies of the code to be compatible with `ModelingToolkit.jl`.
-   [#17](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/17): add documentation to core functions with examples.
-   [#19](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/19): some small optimizations to the code
-   [#20](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/20): fix a small issue in matrix invertibility for a test
-   [#22](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/22) and [#23](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/23): Adding tutorials on how to use the package.
-   [#25](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/25): adding `julia` to the compatibility list and finally registering the package ðŸŽ‰
-   [#30](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/30): adding compatibility with `ODESystem` objects. Now there are two ways of running `StructuralIdenifiability.jl`: via `ODE` class that comes with the package as well as the `ODESystem` of `ModelingToolkit.jl`.

### Open PRs

There are some PRs that remain open for now as of writing this. They focus on minor things like warnings for particular input types (non-integer coefficients, special functions, etc.) for which the identifiability solution is not defined.

-   [#26](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/26): this pr is an attempt to investigate an issue which occurs with one of our dependencies.
-   [#32](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/32): replacing deprecated functions from our package dependency
-   [#34](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/34): check for non-integer coefficients in the input system of the `ODESystem` object. This PR will also include checks for presence of special functions and functions in the numerator. The latter are, as of writing this post, only supported via `ODE` class of `StructuralIdentifiability.jl`

## Future work

Current challenge is PR [#34](https://github.com/SciML/StructuralIdentifiability.jl/pull/34) after which we will release the changes. There will probably be a separate PR to resolve support for rational functions with `ODESystem`.

## Final Thoughts

I am extremely grateful to my mentors, [Christopher Rackauckas](https://www.chrisrackauckas.com/), [Yingbo Ma](https://yingboma.github.io) as well as [Shashi Gowda](http://shashi.biz/) for their help during this summer.

Huge shout out goes also to my colleague [Gleb Pogudin](https://pogudingleb.github.io/) who is the original package developer.

This was a great experience learning about Julia language and open source in general, it motivates me to contribute to open source much more!
